# Diabetes-Detector-by-Bitlords (The Heritage School)
Our project is an AI model that can tell its user if they are at a risk of having diabtetes and if they should take a fasting blood sugar test.
The main goal was to give the user an idea as to if they should take the test as it is relatively expensive and can arouse a fear of blood and needles within people. 
For using the model, the user only has to enter his age, gender, weight, height and blood pressure. The program will calculate the BMI for the user and enter it in the final array of data needed to determine the output. 
However, the model is still not 100% accurate and cannot predict 'anomalies' as in the person does not have an irregular or heightened weight, height, or blood pressure.
